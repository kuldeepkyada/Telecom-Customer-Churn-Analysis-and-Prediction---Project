# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning models. The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key churn factors, feature engineering, and applying various classification algorithms.
Class imbalance was handled using oversampling techniques like RandomOverSampler and SMOTE to improve recall for churners.
The goal is to help telecom providers proactively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies.

üìä Dataset
The dataset contains telecom customer information, including:

Demographic details: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents

Service details: PhoneService, InternetService, Contract, PaymentMethod

Usage & charges: Tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges

Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

üîç Steps Followed
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values & data type corrections

Encoded categorical variables

Standardized numerical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized churn rates by contract type, tenure, payment method

Correlation analysis between churn and other variables

üìà Results
Best Recall for Churn: 0.82 (Stacking Classifier + Oversampling)

Best Balanced Performance: Accuracy ~79%, Recall ~0.70, Precision ~0.60 (Threshold tuning)

High recall helps catch most churners, enabling better retention strategies.
